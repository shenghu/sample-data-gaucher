5. **IMDELLTRA Dosage Modifications and Adverse Reaction Management** 

No dose reduction for IMDELLTRA is recommended. See Table 5 and Table 6 for recommended actions for the management of CRS, neurologic toxicity including ICANS respectively and Table 7 for cytopenias, infections and other adverse reactions. 

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 

Diagnose CRS based on clinical presentation *[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]*. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. 

If CRS is suspected, manage according to the recommendations in Table 5. Monitor patients who experience Grade 2 or higher CRS (e.g., hypotension not responsive to fluids, or hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen) with continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  

For severe or life-threatening CRS, recommend administering tocilizumab or equivalent therapy and intensive monitoring (e.g., ICU) for supportive therapy. Perform laboratory testing to monitor for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hematology parameters, as well as pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and hepatic function.

**4  CONTRAINDICATIONS**  None*.* 

**5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**  

1. **Cytokine Release Syndrome**   

IMDELLTRA can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS) including serious or life- threatening reactions. 

In the pooled safety population *[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)],* CRS occurred in 55% of patients who received IMDELLTRA, including 34% Grade 1, 19% Grade 2, 1.1% Grade 3 and 0.5% Grade 4. Recurrent CRS occurred in 24% of IMDELLTRA-treated patients including 18% Grade 1 and 6% Grade 2. 

Most events (43%) of CRS occurred after the first dose with 29% of patients experiencing any grade CRS after the second dose  and 9% of patients experiencing CRS following the third dose or later. Following the Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 infusions, 16%, 4.3%, and 2.1% of patients experienced ≥ Grade 2 CRS, respectively. The median time to onset of all grade CRS from most recent dose of IMDELLTRA was 13.5 hours (range: 1 to 268 hours). The median time to onset of ≥ Grade 2 CRS from most recent dose of IMDELLTRA was 14.6 hours (range: 2 to 566 hours). 

31 **of 31** 

Reference ID: 5382428 

Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS included pyrexia, hypotension, fatigue, tachycardia, headache, hypoxia, nausea and vomiting. Potentially life-threatening complications of CRS may include cardiac dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurologic toxicity, renal and/or hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

Administer IMDELLTRA following the recommended step-up dosing and administer concomitant medications before and after Cycle 1 IMDELLTRA infusions as described in Table 3 to reduce the risk of CRS *[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].* Administer IMDELLTRA in an appropriate health care facility equipped to monitor and manage CRS. Ensure patients are well hydrated prior to administration of IMDELLTRA. 

Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS during treatment with IMDELLTRA. At the first sign of CRS, immediately discontinue IMDELLTRA infusion, evaluate the patient for hospitalization and institute supportive care based on severity. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMDELLTRA based on severity *[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].* Counsel patients to seek medical attention should signs if symptoms of CRS occur. 

2. **Neurologic Toxicity Including ICANS**  

IMDELLTRA can cause serious or life-threatening neurologic toxicity, including ICANS. 

In the pooled safety population *[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)],* neurologic toxicity including ICANS, occurred in 47% of patients who received IMDELLTRA, including 10% Grade 3. The most frequent neurologic toxicities were headache (14%), peripheral neuropathy (7%), dizziness (7%), insomnia (6%), muscular weakness (3.7%), delirium (2.1%), syncope (1.6%) and neurotoxicity (1.1%).  

ICANS occurred in 9% of IMDELLTRA-treated patients *[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].* Recurrent ICANS occurred in 1.6% of patients. Most patients experienced ICANS following cycle 2 day 1 (24%). Following Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 infusions, 0.5%, 0.5% and 3.7% of patients experienced ≥ Grade 2 ICANS, respectively. The median time to onset of ICANS from the first dose of IMDELLTRA was 29.5 days (range: 1 to 154 days). ICANS can occur several weeks following administration of IMDELLTRA. The median time to resolution of ICANS was 33 days (range: 1 to 93 days). 

The onset of ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the absence of CRS. Clinical signs and symptoms of ICANS may include but are not limited to confusional state, depressed level of consciousness, disorientation, somnolence, lethargy, and bradyphrenia. 

Patients receiving IMDELLTRA are at risk of neurologic adverse reactions and ICANS resulting in depressed level of consciousness. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, in the event of any neurologic symptoms until they resolve*.* 

30 **of 30** 

Reference ID: 5382428 

Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity and ICANS during treatment.  At the  first sign  of ICANS, immediately evaluate the patient and provide supportive therapy based on severity. Withhold IMDELLTRA or permanently discontinue based on severity *[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].* 

3. **Cytopenias** 

IMDELLTRA can cause cytopenias including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. 

In the pooled safety population, *[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)],* decreased neutrophils occurred in 12% including 6% Grade 3 or 4 of IMDELLTRA-treated patients. The median time to onset for Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 29.5 days (range: 2 to 213). Decreased platelets occurred in 33% including 3.2% Grade 3 or 4. The median time to onset for Grade 3 or 4 decreased platelets was 50 days (range: 3 to 420). Decreased hemoglobin occurred in 58% including 5% Grade 3 or 4. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with IMDELLTRA.   

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cytopenias. Perform complete blood counts prior to treatment with IMDELLTRA, before each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of cytopenias, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue IMDELLTRA *[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].* 

4. **Infections** 

IMDELLTRA can cause serious infections, including life-threatening and fatal infections. 

In the pooled safety population, *[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)],* infections including opportunistic infections occurred in 41% of patients who received IMDELLTRA. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequent infections were COVID- 19 (9%, majority during the COVID-19 pandemic), urinary tract infection (10%), pneumonia (9%), respiratory tract infection (3.2%), and candida infection (3.2%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with IMDELLTRA and treat as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMDELLTRA based on severity *[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].* 

5. **Hepatotoxicity** 

IMDELLTRA can cause hepatotoxicity.  

In the pooled safety population *[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)],* elevated ALT occurred in 42% with Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevation occurring in 2.1% of IMDELLTRA-treated patients. Elevated AST occurred in 44% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 AST elevation occurring in 3.2%. Elevated bilirubin occurred in 15% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 total bilirubin elevations occurred in 1.6% of patients *[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].* Liver enzyme

Risk Summary 

Based on its mechanism of action, IMDELLTRA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman *[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]*. There are no available data on the use of IMDELLTRA in pregnant women to inform a drug- associated risk.  

In an animal reproduction study, a murine surrogate molecule administered intravenously to pregnant mice crossed the placental barrier*.* 

Tarlatamab-dlle causes T-cell activation and cytokine release; immune activation may compromise pregnancy maintenance. 

Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) and proteins comprising IgG-derived fragment 

crystallizable (Fc) domains are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, IMDELLTRA has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise women of the potential risk to the fetus. 

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively.

In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, a murine surrogate molecule was administered intravenously to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis. The surrogate molecule crossed the placental barrier and did not cause maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity.  

2. **Lactation**  Risk Summary 

   There are no data on the presence of tarlatamab-dlle in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed child to IMDELLTRA are unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with IMDELLTRA and for 2 months after the last dose. 

3. **Females and Males of Reproductive Potential**    

IMDELLTRA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman  *[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]*. 

Pregnancy Testing 

Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating IMDELLTRA.  

Contraception *Females* 

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment 

with IMDELLTRA and for 2 months after the last dose. 

4. **Pediatric Use**  

The safety and effectiveness of IMDELLTRA have not been established in pediatric patients. 

5. **Geriatric Use** 

Of the 187 patients with SCLC who received IMDELLTRA 10 mg as a single agent, 54% were 65 years of age or older and 12% were 75 years of age or older. No overall

Reference ID: 5382428 

differences in IMDELLTRA pharmacokinetics, or safety were observed between older patients (≥ 65 years of age) and younger patients. Clinical studies of IMDELLTRA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 

**11  DESCRIPTION**  

Tarlatamab-dlle is a bispecific DLL3-directed CD3 T-cell engager that binds to DLL3 expressed on the surface of cells, including tumor cells, and CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells. Tarlatamab-dlle is produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells. It consists of 982 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 105 kilodaltons. 

IMDELLTRA (tarlatamab-dlle) for injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, white to slightly yellow, lyophilized powder in a single-dose vial for reconstitution and further dilution.   

Each 1 mg vial contains tarlatamab-dlle (1 mg), glutamic acid (0.72 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.04 mg), sucrose (37.1 mg), and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH to 4.2. After reconstitution with 1.3 mL of Sterile Water for Injection the resulting concentration is 0.9 mg/mL IMDELLTRA.

polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), sucrose (194.4 mg), and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH to 4.2. After reconstitution with 4.4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection the resulting concentration is 2.4 mg/mL IMDELLTRA. 

IV Solution Stabilizer is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to slightly 

yellow, clear solution. Each vial of IV Solution Stabilizer contains citric acid monohydrate (36.75 mg), lysine hydrochloride (1598.8 mg), polysorbate 80 (7 mg), sodium hydroxide to adjust pH to 7.0, and water for injection. 

**12  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY**  

1. **Mechanism of Action**  

Tarlatamab-dlle is a bispecific T-cell engager that binds to DLL3 expressed on the surface of cells, including tumor cells, and CD3 expressed on the surface of T-cells. Tarlatamab-dlle causes T-cell activation, release of inflammatory cytokines, and lysis of DLL3-expressing cells. Tarlatamab-dlle had anti-tumor activity in mouse models of SCLC. 

2. **Pharmacodynamics**  

30 **of 30** 

Reference ID: 5382428 

Exposure-Response Relationships  

There are no clinically significant exposure-response relationships for efficacy over the exposure range observed between tarlatamab-dlle 10 mg and 100 mg (10 times the highest approved recommended dosage). 

There is an exposure-response relationship between tarlatamab-dlle exposure and neutropenia or neurologic toxicity including ICANS with a higher risk of any grade neutropenia or neurologic toxicity including ICANS at higher exposure. 

Serum Cytokines 

Transient elevation of serum cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-γ were observed at a tarlatamab-dlle dosage of 0.3 mg and above. Peak elevation of cytokines was generally observed 24 hours following the initial dose of IMDELLTRA at 1 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1 and generally returned to baseline levels prior to the next infusion on Cycle 1 Day 8.  

3. **Pharmacokinetics**  

Tarlatamab-dlle pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as geometric mean (CV%) unless otherwise specified. The exposure of tarlatamab-dlle increased dose proportionally in the evaluated dose range of IMDELLTRA 1 mg to 100 mg every 2 weeks (10 times the highest approved recommended dosage). Tarlatamab-dlle steady state exposures were achieved by Cycle 2 Day 15. Pharmacokinetic exposures are summarized for the recommended dosage of IMDELLTRA in Table 15.

a  Parameters are reported as geometric mean (CV%). 

Distribution 

Tarlatamab-dlle steady state volume of distribution is 8.6 L (18.3%). 

Metabolism 

Tarlatamab-dlle is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways. 

Elimination 

30 **of 30** 

Reference ID: 5382428 

Tarlatamab-dlle’s median terminal elimination half-life (min, max) is 11.2 (4.3 to 26.5) days and the estimated systemic clearance is 0.65 L/day (44%) in patients with SCLC. 

Specific Populations 

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tarlatamab-dlle were observed based on age (32 to 82 years), body weight (35 to 149 kg), sex, race (White and Asian), mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min), or mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST > ULN). 

The effects of severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29  mL/min), end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 mL/min), or moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of tarlatamab-dlle are unknown. 

Effects of Tarlatamab-dlle on CYP450 Substrates 

Tarlatamab-dlle causes transient release of cytokines that may suppress CYP450 enzymes and may result in an increased exposure of concomitant CYP substrates during and up to 14 days after occurrence of cytokine release syndrome *[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]*.  

**12.6  Immunogenicity** 

The observed incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of tarlatamab-dlle or of other tarlatamab products. 

In Study DeLLphi-301, of the patients who received recommended step-up and full dosage of IMDELLTRA and were evaluable for presence of ADA against tarlatamab- dlle, 3.2% (4/124) of patients tested positive for anti-tarlatamab-dlle antibodies and none of the patients developed neutralizing antibodies against tarlatamab-dlle based on a cell-based bioassay. Because of the low occurrence of ADA, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and effectiveness of tarlatamab-dlle is unknown. 

**13  NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY**  

**13.1  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility**  

No carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with tarlatamab-dlle. No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of tarlatamab-dlle on fertility.

Reference ID: 5382428 

**14  CLINICAL STUDIES  14.1  Small Cell Lung Cancer**  

The efficacy of IMDELLTRA was evaluated in Study DeLLphi-301 [NCT05060016], an open-label, multicenter, multi-cohort clinical trial. Eligible patients were required to have relapsed/refractory SCLC with disease progression after receiving previous treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other line of prior therapy, an ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) The trial excluded patients with symptomatic brain metastases, evidence of interstitial lung disease or non- infectious pneumonitis, and active immunodeficiency.  

A total of 99 patients received IMDELLTRA intravenously at an initial dose of 1 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1 followed by 10 mg on Days 8, 15, and every 2 weeks thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  

The study population characteristics were: median age 64 years (range: 35 to 82); 48% 

of patients ≥65 years and 10% of patients ≥75 years; 72% male; 58% White, 41% 

Asian; 1% Hispanic or Latino; and 74% have ECOG 1. 

Ninety-seven percent of patients had metastatic disease at baseline; 22% had brain metastases at baseline; and 92% were former/current smokers. All patients received prior platinum-based chemotherapy (median two lines); 74% received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy (including 59% who received anti-PD[L]1 therapy in combination with platinum- based chemotherapy in the frontline setting); 51% received prior topoisomerase I inhibitor (including 20% who received topotecan). Platinum sensitivity status, defined by time to progression after first line platinum therapy, was known for 69/99 patients. Twenty-seven patients (27%) had platinum-resistant SCLC, defined as time to progression < 90 days after first line platinum therapy, while 42 patients (42%) had platinum-sensitive SCLC. 

Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as evaluated by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1. 

Efficacy results are presented in Table 16.

**What is the most important information I should know about IMDELLTRA?** 

**IMDELLTRA may cause serious side effects, including:**  

- **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).** CRS is common during treatment with IMDELLTRA and can also be serious or life-threatening. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of CRS, including: 
- fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher     o  nausea and vomiting 
- low blood pressure  o  confusion, restlessness, or feeling anxious 
- tiredness  o  problems with balance and movement, such as 
- fast heartbeat or dizziness  trouble walking 
- headache  o  heart, liver, or kidney problems 
- shortness of breath or trouble breathing  o  unusual bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time 

**Due to the risk of CRS, you will receive IMDELLTRA on a “step-up dosing schedule”:** 

- The step-up dosing schedule is when you receive a smaller dose of IMDELLTRA on Day 1 of your first treatment cycle (Cycle 1). 
- You will receive the full treatment dose of IMDELLTRA on Day  8 and Day 15 of Cycle 1. You will receive the full treatment dose 1 time every 2 weeks after Day 15 of Cycle 1.  
- If your dose of IMDELLTRA is delayed for any reason, you may need to repeat the “step-up dosing schedule”. 
- Before receiving your Day 1 and Day 8 doses of Cycle 1 of IMDELLTRA, you will be given a medicine to help reduce your risk of CRS. This will be given into your vein by intravenous (IV) infusion. You will also receive IV fluids after each of your Cycle 1 doses of IMDELLTRA (on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15). Your healthcare provider will decide if you need to receive medicines to help reduce your risk of CRS with future doses. 
- See **“How will I receive** **IMDELLTRA?”** for more information about how you will receive IMDELLTRA. 
- **Neurologic Problems.** IMDELLTRA can cause neurologic problems that can be serious or life-threatening. Neurologic problems may happen days or weeks after you receive IMDELLTRA. Your healthcare provider may refer you to a healthcare provider who specializes in neurologic problems. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of neurologic problems, including: 
- trouble speaking, memory loss, or personality  o  weakness or numbness of your arms or legs changes   o  shaking (tremors) 
- confusion, feeling disoriented, slow thinking, or not  o  headache being able to think clearly   o  numbness or tingling of your hands or feet 
- seizure  o  trouble sleeping 
- problems with walking, or loss of balance or  o  fainting or loss of consciousness coordination  o  feeling like you have no energy 

**Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic problems you will receive the following monitoring during treatment with IMDELLTRA:**
