## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on XOLREMDI

Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Reduce XOLREMDI daily dosage when used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor _[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]_.

Monitor more frequently for XOLREMDI adverse reactions that may be associated with an increase in mavorixafor exposure when used concomitantly with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the XOLREMDI daily dosage by steps of 100 mg, if necessary, but not to a dose less than 200 mg.

Mavorixafor is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases mavorixafor maximal concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_, which may increase the risk of XOLREMDI adverse reactions.

Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Avoid concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inducer.

Mavorixafor is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inducer is predicted to decrease mavorixafor Cmax and AUC based upon a mechanistic understanding of its elimination _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_, which may reduce XOLREMDIâ€™s effectiveness.

P-gp Inhibitors

Monitor more frequently for XOLREMDI adverse reactions that may be associated with an increase in mavorixafor exposure when used concomitantly with P-gp inhibitors and reduce the XOLREMDI daily dosage by steps of 100 mg, if necessary, but not to a dose less than 200 mg.

Mavorixafor is a P-gp substrate. Concomitant use with a P-gp inhibitor increases mavorixafor Cmax and AUC _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_, which may increase the risk of XOLREMDI adverse reactions.
