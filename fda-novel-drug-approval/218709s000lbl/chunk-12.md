8.7. Hepatic Impairment

XOLREMDI is not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment.

The pharmacokinetics of mavorixafor have not been studied in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_.

## 11 DESCRIPTION

Mavorixafor is an orally bioavailable CXC Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) antagonist _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]_.

The chemical name of the active ingredient, mavorixafor, is *N*1-(1*H*-benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl)-*N*1- [(8*S*)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-8-yl]butane-1,4-diamine. It has a molecular formula of C21H27N5 and a molecular weight of 349.48 g/mol. Mavorixafor is of the _S_ configuration and its structural formula is provided in Figure 1.

Reference ID: 5371673

Mavorixafor is optically active and is a white to pale yellow to light brown solid. Mavorixafor is hygroscopic above relative humidities of 70%.

Mavorixafor is freely soluble in methanol, 95% ethanol and n-octanol, soluble in toluene, sparingly soluble in DMSO and acetonitrile, and very slightly soluble in HPLC grade water according to the USP solubility criteria.

Mavorixafor is soluble in pH 1.2 to 5.5 aqueous buffers and in pH 6.0 aqueous buffer, sparingly soluble in pH 6.8 aqueous buffer and slightly soluble in pH 7.5 aqueous buffer, according to the USP solubility criteria.

XOLREMDI is a hard gelatin capsule for oral administration. Each capsule contains 100 mg of mavorixafor with the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and sodium stearyl fumarate. The hard gelatin capsule contains FD&C Blue #2, gelatin, and titanium dioxide. The Black Ink contains ammonium hydroxide 28%, ferrosoferric oxide/black iron oxide (E172), isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, and shellac glaze in ethanol.
