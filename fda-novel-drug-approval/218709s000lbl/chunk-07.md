7.2 Effect of XOLREMDI on Other Drugs

CYP2D6 Substrates

The use of XOLREMDI with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance is contraindicated _[see Contraindications (4)]_.

Mavorixafor is a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Mavorixafor increases exposure of CYP2D6 substrates _[see_ _Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.

CYP3A4 Substrates

Monitor for CYP3A4 substrate related adverse reactions more frequently, unless otherwise recommended in the substrate’s Prescribing Information, when XOLREMDI is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates where minimal substrate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Mavorixafor may increase the Cmax and AUC of CYP3A4 substrates _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions from the CYP3A4 substrate.

P-gp Substrates

Monitor for P-gp substrate related adverse reactions more frequently, unless otherwise recommended in the substrate Prescribing Information, when XOLREMDI is used concomitantly with P-gp substrates where minimal substrate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Digoxin: Measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating concomitant use with XOLREMDI, and continue monitoring serum digoxin concentrations as recommended in the Prescribing Information for digoxin _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_.

Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of P-gp. Mavorixafor may increase the Cmax and AUC of P-gp substrates _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions from the P-gp substrate.

Metformin: Monitor for glycemic control and adjust the dose of metformin as necessary. Mavorixafor may decrease the mean Cmax and AUC of metformin, which may reduce metformin’s effectiveness. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown.
