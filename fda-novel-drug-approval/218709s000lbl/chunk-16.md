Distribution

Mavorixafor volume of distribution is 768 L. Mavorixafor is >93% bound to human plasma proteins _in vitro_.

Elimination

Mavorixaforâ€™s terminal half-life was 82 h (34%) with an apparent clearance of 62 L/h (40%) following single-dose administration of XOLREMDI 400 mg in healthy subjects. Mavorixafor exhibits at least partial nonlinear apparent clearance; however, this is not clinically significant at the approved recommended dosage.

_Metabolism_

CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2D6 are primarily responsible for mavorixafor metabolism.

_Excretion_

After a single oral dose of radiolabeled mavorixafor, 74.2% of the administered dose was recovered out of which 61.0% of administered radioactivity was recovered in feces and 13.2% (3% unchanged) was recovered in the urine over the 240-hour collection period in healthy subjects.

Specific Populations

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of mavorixafor were observed based on age (12 to 58 years), sex, or mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <90 mL/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula). The effects of severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to <30 mL/min), end-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min), and moderate to severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mavorixafor are unknown.

Lower body weight was associated with lower mavorixafor clearance. Mavorixafor exposures in patients with WHIM syndrome are comparable between those weighing 50 kg or less who receive 300 mg once daily and those weighing greater than 50 kg who receive 400 mg once daily. Following 400 mg once daily, median Cmax and AUC is 22% and 30% lower, respectively, in patients with higher body weight (85 kg and above) compared to patients with average body weight (50 to less than 85 kg). The difference in exposure between patients with average body weight and patients with higher body weight is not expected to have a clinically significant impact on patient outcomes.
