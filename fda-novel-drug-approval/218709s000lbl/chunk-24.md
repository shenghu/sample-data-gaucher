\*The method compared each XOLREMDI-treated patient to each placebo-treated patient in a pair-wise manner that proceeded in a hierarchical fashion using total infection score, followed by total wart change score if patients could not be

differentiated based on total infection score. The total infection score was calculated by summing up the number of infection events weighted by severity and divided by the total exposure time (in years). Total wart change score was calculated by summing up the regional wart change scores from 3 target regions (lesions).

\*\* n is number of wins.

Analyses of the individual components of this composite endpoint showed an approximately 40% reduction of total infection score, weighted by infection severity, in XOLREMDI-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. The annualized infection rate was reduced approximately 60% in XOLREMDI-treated patients [LS mean (SE) 1.7(0.5)] compared with placebo-treated patients [LS mean (SE) 4.2 (0.7)]. There was no difference in total wart change scores between the XOLREMDI and placebo treatment arms over the 52-week period.
