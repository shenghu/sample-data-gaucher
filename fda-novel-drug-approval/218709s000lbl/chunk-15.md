12.3. Pharmacokinetics

Mavorixafor pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as geometric mean (CV%) in adults with WHIM syndrome unless otherwise specified. Mavorixafor steady state Cmax is 3304 (58.6%) ng/mL and the AUC from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) is 13970 (58.4%) ng\*h/mL following 400 mg once daily.

Mavorixafor demonstrates nonlinear pharmacokinetics with greater than dose-proportional increases in Cmax and AUC0-24h over a dose range of 50 mg (0.125 times the recommended dosage) to 400 mg. Mavorixafor steady state is reached after approximately 9 to 12 days at the highest approved recommended dosage in healthy subjects.

Absorption

Mavorixafor median (range) time to Cmax (Tmax) is 2.8 hours (1.9 to 4 hours) at the highest approved recommended dosage.

_Effect of Food_

_High Fat Meal:_ Mavorixafor Cmax decreased by 66% and AUC decreased by 55% following single- dose administration of XOLREMDI 400 mg with a high-fat meal (1000 calories, 50% fat) to healthy subjects.

_Low Fat Meal:_ Mavorixafor Cmax decreased by 55% and AUC decreased by 51% following single- dose administration of XOLREMDI 400 mg with a low-fat meal (500 calories, 25% fat)![](Aspose.Words.c0d57741-1e92-457a-a6ee-a45779083e95.007.png) to healthy subjects. In addition, a 14% higher mavorixafor Cmax and 18% lower AUC was observed following single-dose administration of XOLREMDI 400 mg with a low-fat meal to healthy subjects after an overnight fast compared to fasting for an additional 4 hours after the XOLREMDI dose.
