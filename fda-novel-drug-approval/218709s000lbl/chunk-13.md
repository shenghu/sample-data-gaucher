## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Mavorixafor is an orally bioavailable CXC Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) antagonist that blocks the binding of the CXCR4 ligand, stromal-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α)/CXC Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12). SDF-1/CXCR4 plays a role in trafficking and homing of leukocytes to and from the bone marrow compartment. Gain of function mutations in the CXCR4 receptor gene that occur in patients with WHIM syndrome lead to increased responsiveness to CXCL12 and retention of leukocytes in the bone marrow. Mavorixafor inhibits the response to CXCL12 in both wild-type and mutated CXCR4 variants associated with WHIM syndrome. Treatment with mavorixafor results in increased mobilization of neutrophils and lymphocytes from the bone marrow into peripheral circulation.
