## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenicity studies with mavorixafor have not been conducted.

Mavorixafor was not genotoxic in an _in vitro_ bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), in an _in vitro_ human lymphocyte culture chromosome aberration assay, or in an _in vivo_ rat bone marrow micronucleus assay.

Fertility studies have not been conducted with mavorixafor. Significant tubular degeneration/atrophy was observed in the testes of dogs at clinical exposure.

## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of XOLREMDI in patients aged 12 years and older with WHIM syndrome was demonstrated in the 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of Study 1 [NCT03995108]. Enrolled patients had a genotype-confirmed variant of CXCR4 consistent with WHIM syndrome, and a confirmed absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤400 cells/µL. Patients were permitted to continue (but not initiate) immunoglobulin therapy at the same dose. Use of other CXCR4 antagonists was not permitted. Baseline patient demographics are shown in Table 2.
