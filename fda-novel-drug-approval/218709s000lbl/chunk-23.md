**Figure 2: TATANC Over Time (Hours) (LS Mean ± 95% CI) by Treatment Group (Study 1)**

For ALC, the mean time (hours) above ALC threshold (TATALC) of 1,000 cells/μL over a 24-hour period was assessed 4 times throughout the study (every 3 months for 12 months). The results over the 52-week period showed that TATALC was statistically significantly greater in patients treated with XOLREMDI (LS mean [SE] 15.8 [1.39] hours) compared with placebo (4.6 [1.15] hours) (p value <0.0001).

The efficacy of XOLREMDI was further assessed in a composite endpoint consisting of total infection score and total wart change score using a Win-Ratio method (Table 4). The Win-Ratio of 2.76 is the number of pairs of XOLREMDI-treated patient “wins” divided by the number of pairs of placebo patient “wins.”
