## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on its mechanism of action, XOLREMDI is expected to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]_. There are no available data on XOLREMDI use in pregnant women informing the risk of embryo-fetal developmental toxicities. Animal models link reductions in CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling to adverse outcomes in mammalian embryo-fetal development _(see Data)_. No definitive animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of mavorixafor on reproduction and fetal development.

Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception _[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]_.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data _Animal Data_

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with mavorixafor to evaluate effects on reproduction and embryo-fetal development. CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling plays an important role in mammalian embryo-fetal and placental development. In mice, CXCR4-/- knockout is embryo lethal and causes multiple developmental toxicities, most notably in the hematopoietic, cardiovascular and nervous systems. CXCR4/SDF-1 levels also have a key role in stimulating trophoblast proliferation and differentiation necessary for appropriate placental growth and function in humans _[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]._
