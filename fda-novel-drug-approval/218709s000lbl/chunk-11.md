8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of XOLREMDI in WHIM syndrome for increasing the number of circulating mature neutrophils and lymphocytes have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Use of XOLREMDI for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)]_.

The safety and effectiveness of XOLREMDI have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age.

8.5. Geriatric Use

In clinical studies of XOLREMDI in patients with WHIM syndrome, 2 (5%) patients were aged 65 years and older, and no patients were aged 75 years and older. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

8.6. Renal Impairment

XOLREMDI is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance[CLcr] 15 to less than 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (CLcr less than 15 mL/min). No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to less than 90 mL/min).

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of mavorixafor were observed in mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to less than 90 mL/min). The pharmacokinetics of mavorixafor have not been studied in subjects with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]_.
