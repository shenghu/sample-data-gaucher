## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

- QTc Interval Prolongation _[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]_

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of XOLREMDI was evaluated in Study 1, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 31 adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with WHIM syndrome _[see Clinical Studies (14)]_. Patients received XOLREMDI 400 mg or 200 mg, based on age and body weight (N=14) or placebo (N=17). One patient received the 200 mg dose, and 13 patients received the 400 mg dose. Note that the 200 mg XOLREMDI daily dose is recommended for use in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors _[see Dosage and Administration (2.1 and 2.2)]_. For all other patients, the recommended dosage is either 400 mg daily (if weighing more than 50 kg) or 300 mg daily (if weighing up to 50 kg), unless dose reductions are needed due to concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or P-gp inhibitors _[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]_.

The data below are based on the 52-week, placebo-controlled portion of the study. Twelve patients received XOLREMDI for at least 6 months, and 10 patients received XOLREMDI for at least one year. Table 1 summarizes the most common adverse reactions (>10%) in Study 1, which were thrombocytopenia, pityriasis, rash, rhinitis, epistaxis, vomiting, and dizziness.

Thrombocytopenia 3 (21%) 0 Pityriasis 2 (14%) 0 Rash 2 (14%) 0 Rhinitis 2 (14%) 0 Epistaxis 2 (14%) 1 (6%) Vomiting 2 (14%) 1 (6%) Dizziness 2 (14%) 1 (6%)

Serious adverse reactions of thrombocytopenia occurred in 3 of the 14 patients who received XOLREMDI, two of which occurred in the setting of infection or febrile neutropenia.
