7.3 Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval

Obtain an electrocardiogram when initiating, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated in patients receiving concomitant medications with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval _[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]_.

XOLREMDI causes QTc interval prolongation _[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]_. Concomitant use of XOLREMDI with other products that prolong the QTc interval may result in a greater increase in the QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation, including torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and sudden death _[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]_.
