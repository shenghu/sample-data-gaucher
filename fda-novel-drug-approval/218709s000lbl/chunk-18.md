_CYP3A4 Substrates:_ Midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) Cmax increased by 1.1-fold (CI90%: 1.0 to 1.3) and AUC increased by 1.7-fold (CI90%: 1.4 to 2.1) following concomitant use with XOLREMDI 400 mg in healthy subjects.

_P-gp Substrates:_

_Digoxin:_ Digoxin Cmax increased by 1.5-fold (CI90%: 1.3 to 1.8) and AUC increased by 1.6-fold (CI90%: 1.4 to 1.9) following concomitant use of a single oral dose of a transporter cocktail containing 0.25 mg of digoxin with XOLREMDI dosed to steady state (400 mg/day) in healthy subjects.

_Metformin:_ Metformin Cmax decreased by 35% (CI90%: 17 to 49%) and AUC decreased by 35% (CI90%: 20 to 47%) following concomitant use of a single oral dose of a transporter cocktail containing 10 mg of metformin with XOLREMDI dosed to steady state (400 mg/day) in healthy subjects.

_Other Drugs:_ No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), losartan (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), furosemide (OAT1 and OAT3 substrate) and oral contraceptives were observed following concomitant use with mavorixafor.

_In Vitro Studies_

_CYP450 Enzymes:_ Mavorixafor is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, and CYP2C19, but is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP4A11. Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (time dependent), CYP3A5, CYP2D6, CYP2B6, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Mavorixafor is an inducer of CYP1A2, but not an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.

_Transporter Systems:_ Mavorixafor is a substrate of P-gp, but not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 or MATE2-K. Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of P-gp, OCT2, and MATE1, but is not an inhibitor of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, and MATE2-K.
