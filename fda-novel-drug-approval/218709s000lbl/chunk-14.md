12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC)

ANC and ALC peaked at 4 hours after XOLREMDI dosing and returned towards baseline within 24 h after dosing. Over mavorixafor doses of 50 mg (0.125 times the maximum recommended dosage) to 400 mg once daily, higher mavorixafor exposure at steady state was associated with longer mean time (hours) above ANC threshold (TATANC) of 500 cells/μL and longer mean time (hours) above ALC threshold (TATALC) of 1,000 cells/μL over a 24-hour period.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a thorough QT (TQT) study, the maximum mean increase in the QTc interval was 15.6 ms (upper bound of the 90% confidence interval = 19.8 ms) after administration of XOLREMDI 800 mg (2 times the maximum recommended dose) in healthy volunteers _[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]_. In concentration-QT analysis the increase in the QTc interval was concentration-dependent.
