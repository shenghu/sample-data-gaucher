_Pediatric Patients_

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of mavorixafor were identified in pediatric patients aged 12 to <17 years with WHIM syndrome compared to adult patients after accounting for differences in body weight.

Drug Interaction Studies

_Clinical Studies_

_Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:_ The systemic exposure of mavorixafor following concomitant administration of a single dose of XOLREMDI 200 mg (0.5 times the recommended dosage for adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older weighing over 50 kg) with 200 mg itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor) dosed to steady state was similar to the mavorixafor systemic exposure from a single dose of XOLREMDI 400 mg administered alone in healthy subjects. These results suggest an approximate increase in mavorixafor exposure by 2-fold due to itraconazole.

_CYP2D6 Substrates:_ Dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) Cmax increased by 6-fold (CI90%: 5.1 to 8.3) and AUC increased by 9-fold (CI90%: 6.5 to 12.3) following concomitant use with XOLREMDI 400 mg in healthy subjects.
